 * Testcase Example:  '["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]'
 *
 * Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) *
 * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may
 * assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two
 * words exist, return 0.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
 * Output: 16 
 * Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
 * Output: 4 
 * Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
 * Output: 0 
 * Explanation: No such pair of words.
