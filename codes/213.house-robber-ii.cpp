 *
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
 * house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are
 * arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last
 * one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and it will
 * automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on
 * the same night.
 * 
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of
 * each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight
 * without alerting the police.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [2,3,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money
 * = 2),
 * because they are adjacent houses.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money =
 * 3).
 * Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
