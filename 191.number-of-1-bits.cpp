 * Testcase Example:  '00000000000000000000000000001011'
 *
 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1'
 * bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a
 * total of three '1' bits.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 00000000000000000000000010000000
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a
 * total of one '1' bit.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
 * Output: 31
 * Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a
 * total of thirty one '1' bits.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type.
 * In this case, the input will be given as signed integer type and should not
 * affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the
 * integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
 * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement
 * notation. Therefore, in Example 3 above the input represents the signed
 * integer -3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
